The interior is just beautiful. / So they performed. / That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good. / - They never brought a salad we asked for. / This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff. / Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed. / The worst was the salmon sashimi. / Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal. / This was like the final blow! / I found this place by accident and I could not be happier. / seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. / Overall, I like this place a lot. / The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive. / Ample portions and good prices. / Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table. / My first visit to Hiro was a delight! / Service sucks. / The shrimp tender and moist. / There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again. / Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick. / On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service. / Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register. / The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section. / It's too bad the food is so damn generic. / The burger is good beef, cooked just right. / If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!! / My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing. / We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside. / He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table. / Their chow mein is so good! / They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food. / The portion was huge! / Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu. / The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant. / Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom. / The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked. / The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless. / At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes. / This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!! / The cocktails are all handmade and delicious. / We'd definitely go back here again. / We are so glad we found this place. / Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount. / Always a great time at Dos Gringos! / Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing / We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy. / A great way to finish a great. / The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected. / - Really, really good rice, all the time. / The service was meh. / It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk. / I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense. / The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well. / 2 times - Very Bad Customer Service ! / The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well. / Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good. / There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company. / Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up. / walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating. / The turkey and roast beef were bland. / This place has it! / The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old. / I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try. / The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying. / All I have to say is the food was amazing!!! / Omelets are to die for! / Everything was fresh and delicious! / In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience. / It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party. / Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN! / Best breakfast buffet!!! / say bye bye to your tip lady! / We'll never go again. / Will be back again! / Food arrived quickly! / It was not good. / On the up side, their cafe serves really good food. / Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!

/ The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal! / The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing. / Will go back next trip out. / Sooooo good!! / REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good. / At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy. / This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit. / Nice, spicy and tender. / Good prices. / Check it out. / It was pretty gross! / I've had better atmosphere. / Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did. / Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing. / I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine. / Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries. / Service was fine and the waitress was friendly. / The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten. / We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night. / Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES! / Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that... / Phenomenal food, service and ambiance. / I wouldn't return. / Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas. / This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food. / Penne vodka excellent! / They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers. / The management is rude. / Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even. / Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations. / I had a seriously solid breakfast here. / This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas. / He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas. / My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions. / Don't do it!!!! / The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us. / My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service. / And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me. / Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food. / The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated. / The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow. / The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace. / I give it 2 thumbs down / We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us. / My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away. / This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay. / We waited for forty five minutes in vain. / Crostini that came with the salad was stale. / Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!

/ Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter. / Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back. / The service here leaves a lot to be desired. / The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness. / Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while. / We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order. / The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor. / I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack. / I dressed up to be treated so rudely! / It was probably dirt. / Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor. / I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible. / The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined. / Interesting decor. / What I really like there is the crepe station. / Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good. / you can watch them preparing the delicious food!) / Both of the egg rolls were fantastic. / When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing. / I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied. / I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine. / The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!
